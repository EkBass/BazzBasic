                <h2>ABOUT</h2>
                <p>Unlike many programming languages, BazzBasic does not aim to be the most powerful or versatile tool.</p>
                <p>It is also not a clone or a remake of any previous BASIC programming language.</p>
                <p>It is intended to be easy, fun, and provide those small but significant moments of success that early BASIC programming languages ​​offered decades ago.</p>
                <p>But with a slightly more modern twist.</p>

                <h2>BASIC</h2>
                <p>After more than six decades, BASIC is still one of the easiest ways to reveal your curiosity.</p>
                <p>It's easy to get started with and offers a rewarding experience with little effort.</p>
                <p>Simple syntax, modern features, and you'll be creating your first little game in a couple of evenings, hours perhaps.</p>

                <h2>CURIOSITY</h2>
                <p>Many of today's experienced programmers started in the 80s by familiarizing themselves with the BASIC interpreters that came with home computers of the time.</p>
                <p>The movement of a yellow ball on the screen, a program that printed lottery numbers, a handwritten text adventure... the list is endless.</p>
                <p>All fueled by one thing:<br>
                    <b>Curiosity.</b><br>

                <h2>STORY</h2>
                <p>Although over the years, as my own skills have grown, I have moved on to more versatile and modern languages, BASIC has always been something that has been fun to try out many different things with.</p>
                <p>Sometimes it's great to just make a simple adventure game again, a lottery machine, a quiz, or even just those balls bouncing on the screen.</p>
                <p>BazzBasic was created with this in mind.</p>
                <p>I wanted to create a language that makes it easy for you to give free rein to your curiosity and program something.</p>
                <p>And when you finish your first little game, you may crave something bigger and better.</p>
                <p>Maybe one day you will move on to another programming language, but then BazzBasic will have succeeded in doing what it was intended for.</p>
                <p>To arouse your curiosity.</p>
