# AI assisted learning

I downloaded the current documentation for Claude.AI, ChatGPT and Mistrall Le Chat to review and asked them to develop a guide for the BazzBasic language that works precisely as an aid to artificial intelligence.

This is the end result that all three *"were"* satisfied with.

In the *AI service* you prefer, upload it directly as a file, add it as a project file or agent guide.

With this guide, any AI can help you learn or use BazzBasic effectively.
