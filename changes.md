#### Fast Trigonometry (Lookup Tables)

For graphics-intensive applications (games, raycasting, animations), BazzBasic provides fast trigonometric functions using pre-calculated lookup tables. These are significantly faster than standard `SIN`/`COS` functions but have 1-degree precision.

**Performance:** ~20x faster than `SIN(RAD(x))` for integer degree values.

**Memory:** Uses ~5.6 KB when enabled (360 values � 2 tables � 8 bytes).


##### FastTrig(enable)
Enables or disables fast trigonometry lookup tables.

**Parameters:**
- `TRUE` (or any non-zero value) - Creates lookup tables
- `FALSE` (or 0) - Destroys lookup tables and frees memory

**Important:** Must call `FastTrig(TRUE)` before using `FastSin`, `FastCos`, or `FastRad`.

```vb
' Enable at program start
FastTrig(TRUE)

' Use fast trig functions...
LET x$ = FastCos(45)
LET y$ = FastSin(45)

' Disable at program end to free memory
FastTrig(FALSE)
```


##### FastSin(angle)
Returns the sine of an angle (in degrees) using a lookup table.

**Parameters:**
- `angle` - Angle in degrees (automatically normalized to 0-359)

**Returns:** Sine value (-1.0 to 1.0)

**Precision:** 1 degree (sufficient for most games and graphics)

```vb
FastTrig(TRUE)

PRINT FastSin(0)    ' Output: 0
PRINT FastSin(90)   ' Output: 1
PRINT FastSin(180)  ' Output: 0
PRINT FastSin(270)  ' Output: -1

' Angles are automatically wrapped
PRINT FastSin(450)  ' Same as FastSin(90) = 1
PRINT FastSin(-90)  ' Same as FastSin(270) = -1

FastTrig(FALSE)
```


##### FastCos(angle)
Returns the cosine of an angle (in degrees) using a lookup table.

**Parameters:**
- `angle` - Angle in degrees (automatically normalized to 0-359)

**Returns:** Cosine value (-1.0 to 1.0)

**Precision:** 1 degree (sufficient for most games and graphics)

```vb
FastTrig(TRUE)

PRINT FastCos(0)    ' Output: 1
PRINT FastCos(90)   ' Output: 0
PRINT FastCos(180)  ' Output: -1
PRINT FastCos(270)  ' Output: 0

' Use in raycasting
FOR angle$ = 0 TO 359
    LET dx$ = FastCos(angle$)
    LET dy$ = FastSin(angle$)
    ' Cast ray in direction (dx, dy)
NEXT

FastTrig(FALSE)
```


##### FastRad(angle)
Converts degrees to radians using an optimized formula.

**Parameters:**
- `angle` - Angle in degrees (automatically normalized to 0-359)

**Returns:** Angle in radians

**Note:** This function doesn't require `FastTrig(TRUE)` but is included for consistency.

```vb
PRINT FastRad(90)   ' Output: 1.5707963267948966 (HPI)
PRINT FastRad(180)  ' Output: 3.141592653589793 (PI)
PRINT FastRad(360)  ' Output: 6.283185307179586 (2*PI)
```


##### Fast Trig Example: Raycasting

```vb
REM Fast raycasting demo
SCREEN 12

' Enable fast trigonometry
FastTrig(TRUE)

LET player_angle$ = 0
LET num_rays# = 320

[mainloop]
    ' Update player rotation
    LET player_angle$ = player_angle$ + 1
    IF player_angle$ >= 360 THEN player_angle$ = 0
    
    ' Cast all rays
    FOR ray$ = 0 TO num_rays# - 1
        LET ray_angle$ = player_angle$ + ray$
        
        ' Fast lookup instead of SIN(RAD(angle))
        LET dx$ = FastCos(ray_angle$)
        LET dy$ = FastSin(ray_angle$)
        
        ' Raycast logic here...
        ' (20x faster than using SIN/COS!)
    NEXT
    
    IF INKEY = KEY_ESC# THEN GOTO [cleanup]
    GOTO [mainloop]

[cleanup]
' Free memory
FastTrig(FALSE)
END
```


##### When to Use Fast Trig

**Use FastTrig when:**
- Rendering graphics at high frame rates (60+ FPS)
- Raycasting or ray tracing
- Rotating sprites or shapes
- Particle systems with many particles
- Any loop that calls `SIN`/`COS` hundreds of times per frame

**Use regular SIN/COS when:**
- Math calculations requiring high precision
- One-time calculations
- Angles are not in integer degrees
- Memory is extremely limited

### 7th Feb. 2026

- Added keyword **HPI** which returns raw coded 1,5707963267929895
- Added keyword **PI** which returns 3.14159265358979  
- Added keywords **RAD** & **DEG**
  
**PI** and **HPI** are raw coded values, so no math involved. Should make performance much better.

```vb
REM Test RAD and DEG functions
PRINT "Testing RAD() and DEG() functions"
PRINT

REM Test degrees to radians
PRINT "90 degrees = "; RAD(90); " radians"
PRINT "180 degrees = "; RAD(180); " radians"
PRINT "360 degrees = "; RAD(360); " radians"
PRINT

REM Test radians to degrees  
PRINT "PI radians = "; DEG(PI); " degrees"
PRINT "PI/2 radians = "; DEG(PI/2); " degrees"
PRINT

REM Test with trigonometry
PRINT "SIN(RAD(90)) = "; SIN(RAD(90))
PRINT "COS(RAD(180)) = "; COS(RAD(180))
PRINT

END
```

```batch

90 degrees = 1.5707963267948966 radians
180 degrees = 3.141592653589793 radians
360 degrees = 6.283185307179586 radians

PI radians = 179.99999999999983 degrees
PI/2 radians = 89.99999999999991 degrees

SIN(RAD(90)) = 1
COS(RAD(180)) = -1

### 1st Feb 2026

The documentation has been worked on and is now a bit better than good.

BazzBasic supports creating libraries: bazzbasic.exe -lib file.bas

LINE INPUT is now in the list of supported commands

Version 0.7 released to this date

## Jan 2026

### 18th Jan 2026
With all the previous add-ons, BazzBasic ver. 0.6 is now available as binary and source.


### 18th Jan 2026
Merging BazzBasic and basic code into a single executable file is now possible.

_bazzbasic.exe -exe filename.bas_ produces the _filename.exe_ file.

BazzBasic does not compile the BASIC code, but rather includes it as part of itself.

**Supported Formats**

**Format:** PNG  
Transparency: Full alpha (0-255)  
Recomended  

**Format**: BMP  
Transparency: None  
Legacy support

### 18th Jan 2026
Generated a manual with Docify.   
BazzBasic homepage now links to it.

Major idea is, that github wiki becomes a as development wiki and this docify as user wiki.

---

### 17th Jan 26
Fixed a bug that prevented to use custom resolution with SCREEN 0  
Terminal now closes if no errors when running via IDE  
Small gap between IDE line numbers and user code.

---

### 17th Jan 26
BazzBasic has now in-built simple IDE.  
Start _bazzbasic.exe_ with out params to open it.  
If opened with params, the .bas file is interpreted normally.  
After few new features, released as version 0.6

---

### 10th Jan 26
Generated __vsix__ file to add BazzBasic syntaxes for VS Code.  
See https://github.com/EkBass/BazzBasic/blob/main/extras/readme.md
